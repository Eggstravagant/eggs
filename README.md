# Open Source Projects
I put together a folder of abandoned and quick projects; some containing high quality work or some being horrible frameworks.

Materials in this repo should be used as a learning tool, NOT a full game.

Everything is licensed under Apache License 2.0.

Regardless, I hope some people see some use of these.
